# 🧱 Introduction to Wireshark

## 🎯 Objective
Understand the purpose of Wireshark, how to capture packets, and apply basic display filters.

## 🧠 Key Concepts
- What Wireshark does and how it works (packet capture and inspection)
- Difference between Capture Filters and Display Filters
- File formats: `.pcap`, `.pcapng`
- Network interfaces (eth0, wlan0, lo, etc.)


## 🔍 Observations
- Number of total packets captured
- Protocol hierarchy (Statistics → Protocol Hierarchy)
- Top talkers (Statistics → Conversations)

## 🧾 Conclusion
You can now perform basic captures, identify protocols, and navigate Wireshark efficiently.
