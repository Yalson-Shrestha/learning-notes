# üìò Module 6.1: Network Media Types

## üìå Key Concepts
- **Three Media Types**: Copper cables, fiber-optic cables, and wireless transmission
- **Copper Cables**: Use electrical signals, include twisted-pair and coaxial
- **Fiber-Optic Cables**: Use light signals, immune to electromagnetic interference
- **Wireless Transmission**: Uses electromagnetic waves through air
- **Selection Criteria**: Distance, environment, data speed/amount, and cost
- **Common Standards**: RJ-45 connectors for Ethernet, BNC/F-type for coaxial, various fiber connectors

## üîß Technical Details

### Copper Cable Types
**Twisted-Pair (UTP):**
- **Construction**: 8 wires arranged in 4 color-coded twisted pairs
- **Connector**: RJ-45
- **Use**: Most common Ethernet connections
- **Advantage**: Reduces electromagnetic interference through twisting
- **Standards**: Must follow specific wiring patterns (T568A/T568B)

**Coaxial Cable:**
- **Construction**: Single solid copper core with insulation and shielding
- **Connectors**: BNC or F-type screw-on
- **Use**: Cable TV, satellite systems, high-frequency transmission
- **Shielding**: Metal mesh protects against electromagnetic interference

### Fiber-Optic Cable
- **Construction**: Glass or plastic core (hair-thin) with reflective cladding
- **Signal Type**: Light pulses instead of electrical signals
- **Immunity**: Not affected by electromagnetic interference
- **Distance**: Can transmit over much longer distances than copper
- **Speed**: Very high bandwidth capabilities
- **Applications**: Backbone networks, enterprise environments, data centers

### Wireless Transmission
- **Medium**: Air (no physical media)
- **Signal**: Electromagnetic waves at specific frequencies
- **Encoding**: Data modulated onto carrier waves
- **Flexibility**: Mobile connectivity without physical constraints

### Media Selection Criteria
| Criteria | Considerations |
|---|---|
| **Distance** | Copper: Short to medium distances<br>Fiber: Long distances<br>Wireless: Varies by technology |
| **Environment** | EMI susceptibility, physical installation constraints, environmental factors |
| **Data Requirements** | Bandwidth needs, speed requirements, latency sensitivity |
| **Cost** | Cable cost, installation expense, maintenance requirements |
