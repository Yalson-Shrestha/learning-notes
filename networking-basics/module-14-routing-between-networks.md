# üìò Module 14: Routing Between Networks

# üìò Module 14.1: The Need for Routing

## üìå Key Concepts
- **Network Segmentation**: Dividing large networks into smaller, manageable segments
- **Broadcast Containment**: Reducing broadcast traffic by creating smaller broadcast domains
- **Security Isolation**: Separating departments to control access and improve security
- **Geographical Division**: Supporting network expansion across different locations
- **Router Role**: Creates boundaries between networks and enables inter-network communication
- **Routing Process**: Determining the best path to forward packets between networks

---

## üîß Technical Details

### Reasons for Network Division
**1. Broadcast Containment:**
- Large broadcast domains cause performance degradation
- Every device processes every broadcast, even irrelevant ones
- Smaller domains limit broadcast scope and improve efficiency

**2. Security Segmentation:**
- Prevents unauthorized access between departments
- Isolates sensitive areas (e.g., Accounting, Network Management)
- Enables access control policies between segments

**3. Geographical Requirements:**
- Supports network expansion to different buildings/floors
- Accommodates departmental moves and reorganizations
- Enables distributed network architecture

### Router Functionality
**Network Separation:**
- Each router interface connects to a different network
- Creates separate broadcast domains
- Defines distinct IP network boundaries

**Routing Decisions:**
- **Layer 3 Operation**: Makes forwarding decisions based on IP addresses
- **Path Determination**: Identifies best route to destination networks
- **Packet Processing**: De-encapsulates and re-encapsulates frames at each hop

### Packet Forwarding Process
**Source to Router:**
1. Host determines destination is remote (different network)
2. Sends packet to default gateway (router)
3. Encapsulates IP packet in frame with router's MAC address

**Router Processing:**
1. Receives and de-encapsulates Ethernet frame
2. Examines destination IP address
3. Consults routing table for best path
4. Re-encapsulates in new frame for next hop
5. Forwards to next router or final destination

## üåê Real-World Examples

**Corporate Network Segmentation:**
Before Division:

Single network: 192.168.0.0/16

400+ devices in one broadcast domain

ARP/DHCP broadcasts affect all devices

After Division:

Network Management: 192.168.1.0/24

Accounting: 192.168.2.0/24

Sales: 192.168.3.0/24

Each department isolated, better performance

**Home vs Enterprise Routing:**
Home Network:

Single router separating home network from internet

Internal: 192.168.1.0/24, External: Public IP from ISP

Basic security and broadcast containment

Enterprise Network:

Multiple routers creating internal segments

Departmental isolation with controlled access

Complex routing between internal networks

**Inter-Department Communication:**
Sales (192.168.3.10) ‚Üí Accounting Server (192.168.2.100)

Sales PC determines server is on different network

Sends packet to Sales router interface (192.168.3.1)

Router forwards through internal network path

Accounting router delivers to server (192.168.2.100)

**Geographical Expansion:**
Main Office: 10.1.0.0/16
Branch Office: 10.2.0.0/16

Routing enables:

Secure communication between locations

Local broadcast domains at each site

Centralized management with distributed operations

# üìò Module 14.2: The Routing Table

## üìå Key Concepts
- **Routing Table**: Database storing network paths and best routes
- **Local vs Remote Communication**: Different processes for same-network vs different-network destinations
- **Default Gateway**: Router interface that handles traffic for remote networks
- **Frame Re-encapsulation**: Routers strip and rebuild Ethernet headers at each hop
- **Network-Based Forwarding**: Routing decisions based on network addresses, not individual hosts
- **ARP for Gateway**: Hosts use ARP to discover router's MAC address for remote communication

---

## üîß Technical Details

### Local Network Communication Process
**Scenario**: H1 (192.168.1.10) ‚Üí H2 (192.168.1.20) - Same Network

**Step 1: Network Determination**
- H1 compares source/destination IPs using subnet mask
- Determines both are on 192.168.1.0 network
- Decision: Send directly, no router needed

**Step 2: ARP Resolution**
- H1 checks ARP table for H2's MAC address
- If not found, sends ARP request broadcast
- Receives ARP reply with H2's MAC (BB:BB)

**Step 3: Frame Construction & Delivery**
- **Source MAC**: AA:AA (H1's NIC)
- **Destination MAC**: BB:BB (H2's NIC)
- **Source IP**: 192.168.1.10 (H1)
- **Destination IP**: 192.168.1.20 (H2)
- Switch delivers frame directly to H2

### Remote Network Communication Process
**Scenario**: H1 (192.168.1.10) ‚Üí H3 (192.168.2.50) - Different Networks

**Step 1: Network Determination**
- H1 determines H3 is on different network (192.168.2.0)
- Decision: Send to default gateway (router)

**Step 2: Gateway ARP Resolution**
- H1 checks ARP table for router's MAC (192.168.1.1)
- If not found, sends ARP request for router
- Receives ARP reply with router's MAC (11:11)

**Step 3: First Hop Frame (H1 ‚Üí Router)**
- **Source MAC**: AA:AA (H1's NIC)
- **Destination MAC**: 11:11 (Router's interface)
- **Source IP**: 192.168.1.10 (H1)
- **Destination IP**: 192.168.2.50 (H3) - **UNCHANGED**

**Step 4: Router Processing**
- Router receives frame, strips Ethernet header
- Examines destination IP (192.168.2.50)
- Consults routing table for best path
- Determines H3 is reachable via FastEthernet 0/2

**Step 5: Second Hop Frame (Router ‚Üí H3)**
- **Source MAC**: 22:22 (Router's Fa0/2 interface)
- **Destination MAC**: CC:CC (H3's NIC) - via ARP
- **Source IP**: 192.168.1.10 (H1) - **UNCHANGED**
- **Destination IP**: 192.168.2.50 (H3) - **UNCHANGED**

### Routing Table Structure
**Key Components:**
- **Network Address**: Destination network (e.g., 192.168.2.0)
- **Interface**: Outgoing router interface (e.g., FastEthernet 0/2)
- **Next Hop**: Next router's IP address (for multi-hop routes)
- **Metric**: Path cost for route selection

**Example Routing Table:**
| Network Destination | Interface | Next Hop | Metric |
|---|---|---|---|
| 192.168.1.0/24 | Fa0/1 | Connected | 0 |
| 192.168.2.0/24 | Fa0/2 | Connected | 0 |
| 10.1.0.0/16 | Fa0/0 | 192.168.1.254 | 10 |
| 0.0.0.0/0 | Fa0/0 | 192.168.1.254 | 1 |

### Default Route Importance
**Purpose**: Catch-all for unknown destinations
- **Notation**: 0.0.0.0/0 ("quad-zero route")
- **Function**: Forward packets when no specific route exists
- **Typical Use**: Points to ISP router for internet traffic
- **Prevention**: Avoids packet drops for unknown networks

## üåê Real-World Examples

**Home Network Scenario:**

Host Configuration:

IP: 192.168.1.105

Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0

Default Gateway: 192.168.1.1

Communication:

To 192.168.1.106: Direct (same network)

To 8.8.8.8: Via router (different network)

Router uses default route to ISP for internet

**Corporate Multi-Network:**
Router R1 Routing Table:

192.168.1.0/24 ‚Üí Fa0/1 (Engineering)

192.168.2.0/24 ‚Üí Fa0/2 (Sales)

192.168.3.0/24 ‚Üí Fa0/3 (HR)

0.0.0.0/0 ‚Üí Fa0/0 (to Internet)

Traffic Flow:
Engineering PC ‚Üí Sales Server:
192.168.1.50 ‚Üí R1 Fa0/1 ‚Üí R1 Fa0/2 ‚Üí 192.168.2.100

**Broadcast Handling:**
Local Broadcast (192.168.1.255):

H1 sends to FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF

Switch floods to all local devices

Router receives but does NOT forward

Remote Communication:

Broadcasts contained within local network

Router prevents broadcast propagation

## üéØ My Takeaways
- **Routing tables work with networks, not individual hosts** - enabling scalable internetworking
- **The default gateway is essential for remote communication** - misconfiguration isolates hosts from external networks
- **Routers rebuild frames at each hop** - MAC addresses change, IP addresses remain constant
- **ARP resolves the "first hop" problem** - converting gateway IP to MAC for local delivery
- **Local vs remote determination happens before sending** - hosts intelligently choose delivery method
- **The default route prevents packet loss** for destinations not explicitly in routing table
- **Understanding this process is crucial for troubleshooting** - many connectivity issues stem from routing problems
- **The separation of Layer 2 and Layer 3 responsibilities** enables global network scalability
